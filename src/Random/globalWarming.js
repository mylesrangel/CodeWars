//Given an array of values return the value at which the two days with the greatest change in temperature
//I.E. given: [22,32,10,15,27,33,50,53] // returns 23 because 27 to 50 is a temp increase of 23

//Note: the value between the days are not the lowest (10) and the highest (53)

//The answer should be given a time complexity of O(n)
